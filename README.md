ABOUT THE PROJECT:
An e-commerce website that sells korean cosmetics and skincare products. Taking advantage of the "korean wave", the website will have a separate section about actors/singers that are ambassadors of certain brands to promote the products.

------------------------------------------------

STORIES:
1. The client should create an account to make an order;
2. Clients can look through a catalogue of the products and add them to a cart;
3. The products are organized in sections/steps of the Korean skincare routine system;
4. The products can also be organized based on the celebrity that is promoting/using the products;
5. They can pay the order by card (Mastercard, Visa etc.);
6. After making an order, the total price is converted into digital currency (loyalty points) which can be later used for another order and get a discount.
   

ADMIN STORIES:
1. The admins have access and also moderate the client database;
2. The admins are able to manage the stock of products in the catalogue.
